== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the site using this plugin comply with GDPR? =

This plugin is designed based on the principle of "Privacy by design" so that you can compliantly run it to GDPR. As guarding against personal data breach, IP addresses in this plugin are encrypted and also can be anonymized by default. It also provides some functions not only to manually erase them but also to automatically remove them when those are exceeded a certain amount/time.

= Does this plugin support multisite? =

Yes. You can synchronize the settings with all the sites on the network when you activate on network and enable "**Network wide settings**" in "**Plugin settings**" section.

= I still have access from blacklisted country. Does it work correctly? =

Absolutely, YES.

Sometimes, a WordFence Security user would report this type of claim when he/she found some accesses in its Live traffic view. But please don't worry. Before WordPress runs, WordFence cleverly filters out malicious requests to your site using <a href="https://php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php#ini.auto-prepend-file" title="PHP: Description of core php.ini directives - Manual">auto_prepend_file</a> directive to include PHP based Web Application Firewall. Then this plugin validates the rest of the requests that pass over Wordfence because those were not in WAF rules, especially you enables "**Prevent Zero-day Exploit**".

It would also possibly be caused by the accuracy of country code in the geolocation databases. Actually, there is a case that a same IP address has different country code.

For more detail, please refer to "[I still have access from blacklisted country.](https://iplocationblock.com/codex/i-still-have-access-from-blacklisted-country/ 'I still have access from blacklisted country. | IP Location Block')". 

= Does this plugin works well with caching? =

The short answer is **YES**, especially for the purpose of security e.g. blocking malicious access both on the back-end and on the front-end.

You can find the long answer and the compatibility list of cache plugins at "[Compatibility with cache plugins](https://iplocationblock.com/codex/compatibility-with-cache-plugins/ 'Compatibility with cache plugins | IP Location Block')".
